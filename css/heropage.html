        <h2 class="highlight"> Jackie Chan </h2>
        <p> I love <span class="highlight emphasize">JACKIE CHAN</span>. He is an actor that for me always gives me good movies. He always make a movie like action but still, he put some comdey inside the movies. I haven't watch all of his movies, but I will you give a list of movies that I like that he playes as the main character on it. </p>
        <dl> List of Movies:

            <p></p>
            <dt> Rush Hours </dt>
            <dd> The movie about 2 detectives, one from Hong KOng (Jackie Chan) and one from Los Angeles (Chris Tucker) need to do some investigations in each movies. They already produce 3 movies up to now. </dd>

            <p></p>
            <dt> Shanghai Noon </dt>
            <dd> The movie about Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) need to work together to solve some troubles to save lives and get some moneys too.</dd>

            <p></p>
            <dt> The Foreigner </dt>
            <dd> The movie is a little bit different than other Jackie Chan movies. For this one, he acted as Quan(JAckie Chan) is a small businessman in London who are looking for the one who is responsible for his daughter's because she was dead by a terrorist bombing. </dd>
