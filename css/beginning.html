            For inline CSS it would be on the line of the code, while embedded CSS it would be on the head of the code, but for external CSS it would be on another file with .css as the type of file.
        </p>

        <p> I think it would be simple and make your codes cleaner when you use the external css, while you can put it to another line of code to use the same settings like you want.

            Selector is used to choose which line of code that you want to change in CSS file.
