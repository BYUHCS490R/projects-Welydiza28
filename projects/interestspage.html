        <h2> About Games </h2>
        <p> I love playing game because I like to explore things. Games always make me curious about the world more and more, especially about how games were made. </p>

        <h2> Example of Games </h2>
        <p> The one type of games that I love is an Open-World games. I love it because I can explore the world and do anything that I want. For example, GTA V, this game allows me to explorte the whole map and complete a story about 3 characters that I can play and customize. I can go anywhere in the map either using cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, or boats. </p>
