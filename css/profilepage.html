    <h1> Hello, my name is Samuel Welyar Ardiza </h1>

    <p> I was born on <em>Jambi, Indonesia</em> in February 28 2001. My family consists of my Dad, Mom, and one older sister. My Dad was a policeman for 25 years and he had his retirement when he was 45 years old. For my mom, she is a housewife who take care of me and my sister. My sister is 4 years older than me. That's a little bit about my family, </p>

    <p> Since my dad was a policemaan, we moved lots of time. As I remember, we moved almost 6 times. For that reason, I moved to 3 different schools. I finished my kindergarten in a small island call Bangka Belitung. Next, I finished my elementary school and junior highschool on a small city in West Java call Sukabumi. Then for my highschool, I finished on a friendly city in Central Java call Salatiga. And now, I'm taking my Bachelor's Degree on a beatiful island call <mark>Hawaii</mark>. That's a short story about my education's journey. </p>

        <li> I love the color "BLUE" </li>
        <li> I love going to the beaches </li>
        <li> I love fishing</li>
    </ol>
