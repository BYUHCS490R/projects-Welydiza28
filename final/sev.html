            <h2> Sniper Elite 5 </h2>
            <p> Sniper Elite 5 is a tactical third person shooter which set during World War 2. The game make you play as an elite sniper, Karl Fairburne, which deployed on missions across Europe to stop the Nazi from winning the war. </p>
            <p> The game is known for its long range sniping system and realistic bullet physics. The game also shows their signature x-ray kill cam that shows the impact of the bullet when it hit a target. Players can choose to do everything in stealthy way or rushing into a gun blazing combat. This game also allows players to play in multiplayer cooperative gameplay. Overall, this game give you some intense feelings and teach you how to be patience, use the right strategies, and make a precision decision in every shots. For me, this is a game that stand out the most in military world war experiences game.</p>
