            <h2> Red Dead Redemption 2 </h2>
            <p> Red Dead Redemption 2 is an open world action adventure game with a set in the late 1800s in the wild west era. The game let you play as Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, who is running away from the law because they rob a bank in Red Dead Redemption 1. </p>
            <p> This game is known for its realistic world, one of the best story in a game, and the attention on details inside the game. All players can explore the big map and do anything they want. They can own horses, hunt and fish, and interact with other characters. Red Dead Redemption 2 also give you the option to play Red Dead Online where players can create their own character and play with their friends. Overall, the game is known for its emotional story, huge map, and slow gameplay so players can enjoy it longer. This game has the best story and detail inside the game from my experience.</p>
